Find Operator - .find() will populate whatever we are looking for.  ie; db.employees.find() will locate all employees and list them.  .find().pretty() will organize it cleaner in the terminal.

Update Operator - updates specific criteria.  ie; Pilots salary was updated 2 times and reflected correctly in terminal.  After each update I searched and the update was successful.

Upserts - It just added a hit to the collection. 

Rename a field - the way this exercise was specifically written in notion, nothing happened when using it in the terminal.
